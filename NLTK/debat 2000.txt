yes indeed we are already too long commodity commodity we depend to markets outside the country and we 've been too long exported in the form of mentahan raw materials, both the rubber kind that coconut oil well wasfishing well it commodity commodity agriculture that strategy to the next well in field of fisheries as well as in the field of agriculture is downstream is the industrialization needs to be built industrial industry fishery as manyprocessing canning so we . exported in the form of items of goods that have been processed already packaging in here already in the labeling in here already built a brand from here so also for commodities commodityplantations to the front we must dare to do hilirisasi prevent that exports we are not in the form of mentahan but minimal goods half- finished or we press to be delivered in the form of goods so and also to areas that relate to the products of agriculture we know children young people have now built an online ecosystem .
which if this can be connected to the offline ecosystem of agricultural products will make it easier for farmers to directly deal with consumers in dealing with buyers through the digital economy .
well thank you very precisely in here lies the problem which I alluded to that economic us wrong directions that occur deindustrialisi and the case is not the strategy that is run by the government was intent Pak Jokowi nice but .
Pak Jokowi has been in power four and a half years why allow import of farmers devastated why not do industrialization but focused infrastructure infrastructure do not facilitate the goods outside the entrance to Indonesia is not the goods Indonesia are out of this problem that we say need no reorientation of strategy development need no policy that is firmly stop the flow money out of the country then focus on establishing the industry in all the fields I agree hilirasik downstream but why Dad does not implement the already four and a half years even Mr allow the Minister Minister Mr. allowing commodities of foreign entry into Indonesia by so fast and so trivial Isuppose so possible .
yes the key is entrepreneurship entrepreneurship and certainty of business and I am sure together Prabowo Password government are strong with the leadership of the firm and favor the entrepreneurs entrepreneurs nationwideto bring certainty effort certainty of law so that the investment that is required to process the material of crude into the material so it can be realized .
Pak Prabowo Mr. Sandi manage economic macro was different to manage economic micro- because of economic macro that aggregate production and side , the demand and the supply of it to be influenced by and is maintained by the policies of the government .
if we are dealing with the economics of micro is only selling and buying only build the industry and then sell them products that exist but economic macro is managing an aggregate aggregate production sector is the primaryexample in the field of mining agricultural plantations then sector secondary in the field of manufacturing I guess not not as easy as it means that require stage stage large here that were we working on the infrastructure thatwe wake up it 'll be connected to the area of regional industry will be connected and the regional department of tourism baseball may immediately reverse the hands of then can build up and then immediately be exported does not need to stage the stage big already many times I convey .
that stages major first is the development of infrastructure we focus on the stages of the second is the development of Source Power of Man that the third is the reform of structural and fourth affairs of technology andinnovation this stage of the stages of large who wish we did .
so back again I kept the light just I do not blame Mr. Jokowi I do not blame this problem mistake we as a nation and has been running a dozen even dozens of years but we must dare to correcting ourselves we are one of the way we should be an example of such .
Republican People's China in four forty years he eliminate poverty four forty years we should be an example of daring to learn from the great do not I do not blame the father 's fault we are all so we have one way we have to go back to law legislation base four five chapters three three learn that good we must dare to plan the development of industrialization created the field work to protect farmers we protect fishermen us that what should we run so Ido not blame you for this mistake big mistake great President President before the father we all have to take responsibility true that the opinion I thank you for .
I believe that the participation of the women in the life of the nation and the state of our very important very vital and actually had a very prominent we 've had President woman and now in election campaign election general ispart of the Ma Ma is very very big very very big so with such with the role they which is so great definite policy policy Act legislation would really really reflect the interests they would not want to because they greatly determine the life of the social politics of the nation Indonesia .
two thirds of the family economy is sustained by .
the activities of women who start businesses both at home and also business enterprises micro small medium- female female great female self is want a policy that is more aligned so that they can get access to the trainingassistance is also access to the capital we see in the movement okay oce program okay oce also domination Ma emak women outside the ordinary they truly become bone backs and we believe that entrepreneurship is to be encouraged more well as the creation of a field of work we see the role of women beyond the ordinary if the economy families are supported by women it could be well into next we believe inequality is able to subtract reducedit significantly we believe the movement okay oce can empower women .
vision mission we did have to give priority to equality of gender because it we will strive continue as much as possible so that women not only be in the field of economics in the field of politics but also in the field ofgovernment in efforts to empower mothers mother besides also economic levels of high but also we have been doing , namely credit umi micro businesses and also micro waqf banks .
that there are at boarding schools and I know exactly that their customers one hundred percent of women , and this is an effort empowerment even had thousands and thousands of mothers mother feels helpless and even theyfeel proud of not only the ideal of ideals by because of the efforts of effort is going to continue our wake will we develop and also in the village the village we are also going to create a name that goddess goddess and dedidedi goddess was what the name suggests the village tour and villages digital .
yes was no goddess there is dedi .
I want to add a little about the program for the economy of women we have a program name meekar of civil servants has been four years of these customers are already four coma two million years of this we are targetingmore than ten million it is the merchant peddlers traders meatball merchant noodles .
The key is empowerment I 've a duty DKI works equally well with PNM and Meekar and we see indeed female great female self- this could be a bone back economic family , but that they are complaining about is of course the lack of access to the market .
how we provide a program that is sustainable we call prabowo password call seven step fitting first is to register the female great female self is who will be the bone back of the economy both we will provide training training iscertainly tiered we want them to have the basic knowledge we are after the belt with assistance for eight fifty percent of the failures of women who plunge into the business is not having a mentor companion and after that wehelp the licensing many a business venture in bloom is difficult to get permits because in housing it not be issued permits us to help its permissions with movement ok oce after that is marketing packaging and finally we helpthe financial administration so that they are literate about how to calculate cash flow profits and losses and so forth and last is access to capital .
for women great female self is beyond the ordinary when given borrow money nine twenty- nine comma- nine percent of the money back .
so I kept right was for the program to bloom it is a loan to the mother 's mother who trade both asongan meatball noodle chicken then venture business house ladder that we give loans only two million three million fourmillion then up to ten million if more than ten million would we bolt to kur the interest of seven per cent and is accompanied by no advisory assistance and has been running four years already four coma two .
million customers later that both are associated with umi that already we do think about one and a half years have also been a coma one million customers have to ultramikro micro be small again if the road is already ourcorrections correctly will we exaggerated by the magnitude of that woman women Indonesia women women Indonesia productive and also could provide income extra for home stair bank endowments micro that weestablished in lodges boarding also at almost nine thirty percent of its customers are women in the neighborhood cottage boarding schools that have a business venture micro- businesses small so that granted loans there are five hundred thousand one million two million and three million have been we do almost two years is the reason that we believe Insha Allah program program three earlier will be able to give independence to the economicfamily .
well thank you the problem of state acceptance is very crucial .
Commission itself says that should we receive 4 thousand trillion every year but it turned out to only 2 thousand trillion means no leakage 2 thousand trillion if I always say the leak in 1000 trillion turns KPK say more in a year 97times when order new Indonesia had tax ratio of its 16% now slumped so 10% means that we lose less over 60 billion dollars each year what steps the concrete is actually malaysia and thailand tax ratio to its own 19% and theycarry out the program to use information technology .
by using computerized so that all transparent and by so quickly could rise up to 19% I believe the program informatics use of technology transparency we can learn and examples from other countries we are also able to go back to 16% and even 19% .
we will separate the bodies reception state of the Ministry of Finance directly report to the president to improve compliance or level of compliance with taxation and ensure tax ratio that will increase to tithe our first in Jakartastart the program mall conscious charity. We had to pick the ball and use technology digital digital economy it will be able to increase the potential of receiving zakat us .
if you want to raise the tax ratio is such that once Mr. Prabowo conveyed in one year would raise the tax ratio of 10 coma becomes 16% if within a year the increase drastically as it means to be there 5% less over 5% of GDP of 15 trillion rupiah 5% means 750 trillion that it will be drawn into the tax anything that happens if it is done will happen shock by the economy because it is the wish we do is raise the tax ratio is gradually to build up a tax .
base as much as possible and it has been we do since we do the tax amnesty Tax amnesty is no declaration of 4800 trillion and we get income from there 114 trillion years that we want to be our tax base we are getting big so that income countries also will be getting a lot but if you live like which was delivered earlier I think this will give a shock the economy for 750 billion that will be in drag as receipts in taxes for charity I gave a pack of clericsMaaruf amen .
yes the matter of zakat and endowments is actually we already have the agency mules baznas casillas and also endowments .
us by because it is now being done intensification and then collect also waqf money is not usually waqf land cemetery madrasah mosque now been developed waqf .
either so maybe Mr. Jokowi one catch I did not say climbed back 16% in one year , but must be no attempt real and one of the way is was to implement a program of informatics use of technology informatics and systems arevery transparent it can quickly raise and I really agree we also want to widen the tax .
base course, we do not want to cause shock economy, but but we also have to dare to pursue those who during this always avoid to pay that should he pay .
we will genjot ratio of taxes one of them is to cut the taxes of workers we will reduce the rate of tax an individual to raise PTKP result later will be felt directly by the community that is a lot of money that exist in pockets ofsociety that could be used for the needs of the day day increase consumption and ultimately insha Allah can create a field of work we believe the time to tax the corporation after tax personal can we scaled back so that we cancompete with other countries to attract investment to whom to field labor son son nation Prabowo Sandi sure shared governance are strong we create taxes for .
Community development .
I was just reading in the media Pak Prabowo that you will do a leap great from eleven percent to six twelve percent so before I tell like it in my in the field of reception of tax is that we are consistent and do reforms in the field oftaxation of service tax online tax it will give impacts are significant at the payer of the tax to come pay taxes because they feel served by well and that already we do now father delivered .
SPT annual it via E-Filing already be out of the house can watch whatever can be accepted this reform in the field of taxation that had we done but it is still much that needs to be we fix that should we do in terms of acceptance of taxes this pack please .
yes for the zakat so that the institution does not only accept zakat but take zakat according to the religious orders khuzbin amwalihin shadaqotun mutathohirun take it so it is not the recipient of zakat from the zakat taker so the way it works is changed as well as endowment efforts to convince the public .
