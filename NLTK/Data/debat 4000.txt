yes indeed we are already too long commodity commodity we depend to markets outside the country and we 've been too long exported in the form of mentahan raw materials, both the rubber kind that coconut oil well wasfishing well it commodity commodity agriculture that strategy to the next well in field of fisheries as well as in the field of agriculture is downstream is the industrialization needs to be built industrial industry fishery as manyprocessing canning so we . exported in the form of items of goods that have been processed already packaging in here already in the labeling in here already built a brand from here so also for commodities commodityplantations to the front we must dare to do hilirisasi prevent that exports we are not in the form of mentahan but minimal goods half- finished or we press to be delivered in the form of goods so and also to areas that relate to the products of agriculture we know children young people have now built an online ecosystem .
which if this can be connected to the offline ecosystem of agricultural products will make it easier for farmers to directly deal with consumers in dealing with buyers through the digital economy .
well thank you very precisely in here lies the problem which I alluded to that economic us wrong directions that occur deindustrialisi and the case is not the strategy that is run by the government was intent Pak Jokowi nice but .
Pak Jokowi has been in power four and a half years why allow import of farmers devastated why not do industrialization but focused infrastructure infrastructure do not facilitate the goods outside the entrance to Indonesia is not the goods Indonesia are out of this problem that we say need no reorientation of strategy development need no policy that is firmly stop the flow money out of the country then focus on establishing the industry in all the fields I agree hilirasik downstream but why Dad does not implement the already four and a half years even Mr allow the Minister Minister Mr. allowing commodities of foreign entry into Indonesia by so fast and so trivial Isuppose so possible .
yes the key is entrepreneurship entrepreneurship and certainty of business and I am sure together Prabowo Password government are strong with the leadership of the firm and favor the entrepreneurs entrepreneurs nationwideto bring certainty effort certainty of law so that the investment that is required to process the material of crude into the material so it can be realized .
Pak Prabowo Mr. Sandi manage economic macro was different to manage economic micro- because of economic macro that aggregate production and side , the demand and the supply of it to be influenced by and is maintained by the policies of the government .
if we are dealing with the economics of micro is only selling and buying only build the industry and then sell them products that exist but economic macro is managing an aggregate aggregate production sector is the primary example in the field of mining agricultural plantations then sector secondary in the field of manufacturing I guess not not as easy as it means that require stage stage large here that were we working on the infrastructure that we wake up it 'll be connected to the area of regional industry will be connected and the regional department of tourism baseball may immediately reverse the hands of then can build up and then immediately be exported does not need to stage the stage big already many times I convey .
that stages major first is the development of infrastructure we focus on the stages of the second is the development of Source Power of Man that the third is the reform of structural and fourth affairs of technology and innovation this stage of the stages of large who wish we did .
so back again I kept the light just I do not blame Mr. Jokowi I do not blame this problem mistake we as a nation and has been running a dozen even dozens of years but we must dare to correcting ourselves we are one of the way we should be an example of such .
Republican People's China in four forty years he eliminate poverty four forty years we should be an example of daring to learn from the great do not I do not blame the father 's fault we are all so we have one way we have to go back to law legislation base four five chapters three three learn that good we must dare to plan the development of industrialization created the field work to protect farmers we protect fishermen us that what should we run so Ido not blame you for this mistake big mistake great President President before the father we all have to take responsibility true that the opinion I thank you for .
I believe that the participation of the women in the life of the nation and the state of our very important very vital and actually had a very prominent we 've had President woman and now in election campaign election general ispart of the Ma Ma is very very big very very big so with such with the role they which is so great definite policy policy Act legislation would really really reflect the interests they would not want to because they greatly determine the life of the social politics of the nation of Indonesia.
two thirds of the family economy is sustained by.
the activities of women who start businesses both at home and also business enterprises micro small medium- female female great female self is want a policy that is more aligned so that they can get access to the training assistance is also access to the capital we see in the movement okay oce program okay oce also domination Ma emak women outside the ordinary they truly become bone backs and we believe that entrepreneurship is to be encouraged more well as the creation of a field of work we see the role of women beyond the ordinary if the economy families are supported by women it could be well into next we believe inequality is able to subtract reduced it significantly we believe the movement okay oce can empower women .
vision mission we did have to give priority to equality of gender because it we will strive continue as much as possible so that women not only be in the field of economics in the field of politics but also in the field of government in efforts to empower mothers mother besides also economic levels of high but also we have been doing , namely credit umi micro businesses and also micro waqf banks .
that there are at boarding schools and I know exactly that their customers one hundred percent of women , and this is an effort empowerment even had thousands and thousands of mothers mother feels helpless and even they feel proud of not only the ideal of ideals by because of the efforts of effort is going to continue our wake will we develop and also in the village the village we are also going to create a name that goddess goddess and dedi dedi goddess was what the name suggests the village tour and villages digital.
yes was no goddess there is dedi .
I want to add a little about the program for the economy of women we have a program name meekar of civil servants has been four years of these customers are already four coma two million years of this we are targeting more than ten million it is the merchant peddlers traders meatball merchant noodles .
The key is empowerment I 've a duty DKI works equally well with PNM and Meekar and we see indeed female great female self- this could be a bone back economic family , but that they are complaining about is of course the lack of access to the market.
how we provide a program that is sustainable we call prabowo password call seven step fitting first is to register the female great female self is who will be the bone back of the economy both we will provide training training iscertainly tiered we want them to have the basic knowledge we are after the belt with assistance for eight fifty percent of the failures of women who plunge into the business is not having a mentor companion and after that we help the licensing many a business venture in bloom is difficult to get permits because in housing it not be issued permits us to help its permissions with movement ok oce after that is marketing packaging and finally we help the financial administration so that they are literate about how to calculate cash flow profits and losses and so forth and last is access to capital .
for women great female self is beyond the ordinary when given borrow money nine twenty- nine comma- nine percent of the money back .
so I kept right was for the program to bloom it is a loan to the mother 's mother who trade both asongan meatball noodle chicken then venture business house ladder that we give loans only two million three million fourmillion then up to ten million if more than ten million would we bolt to kur the interest of seven per cent and is accompanied by no advisory assistance and has been running four years already four coma two .
million customers later that both are associated with umi that already we do think about one and a half years have also been a coma one million customers have to ultramikro micro be small again if the road is already ourcorrections correctly will we exaggerated by the magnitude of that woman women Indonesia women women Indonesia productive and also could provide income extra for home stair bank endowments micro that weestablished in lodges boarding also at almost nine thirty percent of its customers are women in the neighborhood cottage boarding schools that have a business venture micro- businesses small so that granted loans there are five hundred thousand one million two million and three million have been we do almost two years is the reason that we believe Insha Allah program program three earlier will be able to give independence to the economic family .
well thank you the problem of state acceptance is very crucial.
Commission itself says that should we receive 4 thousand trillion every year but it turned out to only 2 thousand trillion means no leakage 2 thousand trillion if I always say the leak in 1000 trillion turns KPK say more in a year 97times when order new Indonesia had tax ratio of its 16% now slumped so 10% means that we lose less over 60 billion dollars each year what steps the concrete is actually malaysia and thailand tax ratio to its own 19% and they carry out the program to use information technology.
by using computerized so that all transparent and by so quickly could rise up to 19% I believe the program informatics use of technology transparency we can learn and examples from other countries we are also able to go back to 16% and even 19%.
we will separate the bodies reception state of the Ministry of Finance directly report to the president to improve compliance or level of compliance with taxation and ensure tax ratio that will increase to tithe our first in Jakarta start the program mall conscious charity. We had to pick the ball and use technology digital digital economy it will be able to increase the potential of receiving zakat us .
if you want to raise the tax ratio is such that once Mr. Prabowo conveyed in one year would raise the tax ratio of 10 coma becomes 16% if within a year the increase drastically as it means to be there 5% less over 5% of GDP of 15 trillion rupiah 5% means 750 trillion that it will be drawn into the tax anything that happens if it is done will happen shock by the economy because it is the wish we do is raise the tax ratio is gradually to build up a tax.
base as much as possible and it has been we do since we do the tax amnesty Tax amnesty is no declaration of 4800 trillion and we get income from there 114 trillion years that we want to be our tax base we are getting big so that income countries also will be getting a lot but if you live like which was delivered earlier I think this will give a shock the economy for 750 billion that will be in drag as receipts in taxes for charity I gave a pack of clerics Maaruf amen .
yes the matter of zakat and endowments is actually we already have the agency mules baznas casillas and also endowments .
us by because it is now being done intensification and then collect also waqf money is not usually waqf land cemetery madrasah mosque now been developed waqf .
either so maybe Mr. Jokowi one catch I did not say climbed back 16% in one year , but must be no attempt real and one of the way is was to implement a program of informatics use of technology informatics and systems arevery transparent it can quickly raise and I really agree we also want to widen the tax.
base course, we do not want to cause shock economy, but but we also have to dare to pursue those who during this always avoid to pay that should he pay .
we will genjot ratio of taxes one of them is to cut the taxes of workers we will reduce the rate of tax an individual to raise PTKP result later will be felt directly by the community that is a lot of money that exist in pockets of society that could be used for the needs of the day day increase consumption and ultimately insha Allah can create a field of work we believe the time to tax the corporation after tax personal can we scaled back so that we can compete with other countries to attract investment to whom to field labor son son nation Prabowo Sandi sure shared governance are strong we create taxes for .
Community development .
I was just reading in the media Pak Prabowo that you will do a leap great from eleven percent to six twelve percent so before I tell like it in my in the field of reception of tax is that we are consistent and do reforms in the field of taxation of service tax online tax it will give impacts are significant at the payer of the tax to come pay taxes because they feel served by well and that already we do now father delivered .
SPT annual it via E-Filing already be out of the house can watch whatever can be accepted this reform in the field of taxation that had we done but it is still much that needs to be we fix that should we do in terms of acceptance of taxes this pack please .
yes for the zakat so that the institution does not only accept zakat but take zakat according to the religious orders khuzbin amwalihin shadaqotun mutathohirun take it so it is not the recipient of zakat from the zakat taker so the way it works is changed as well as endowment efforts to convince the public .
First to develop the Shari'ah financial economy we have formed a national Shari'ah finance committee .
who called KNKS which are chaired by Mr. President himself is to develop the economy and this makes Indonesia as an Islamic finance centers in the world and by because it we also strengthen positions of institutions finance the strengthening of institutional and then also the form of services including fintech then also products in order to give birth to products that more market friendly and then also build resource human are strong we want to encourage that industry lawful in accordance with the vision of mission we will we stimulis not only for the country but also to outside the country .
standard halal we now already become the standard of world halal because it is a standard halal us be a reference to the global halal. We please .
as a country with a population of Muslims the largest in the world we have a force large in the finance sharia , economic sharia and we know that Indonesia now it has been named as the number one in the field of travel kosheris thank God and also briefly again we will open a stall in the near GBK .
in global Islamic economic index we see that I indonesia still rank ten when we as a country to sit the Muslim World should be more give rank much better in order countries with importing as importing products product kosherus number four biggest we should position ourselves as a country that could producing goods items kosher key according to me is the need to create the ecosystem that is not just financial sharia but the economy of sharia ascomprehensively as a whole we declare that the strength we are the power of entrepreneurship us , especially in the field of economy of sharia much a product of sharia my new course .
yesterday campaigned find the product halal network internationally which turned out to be the product of herbal Indonesia which has the ability to export we believe with the spirit we are to strengthen the strong production of our products products kosher we can rule do we continuously flooded by products product imports we believe also the ecosystem that we 're pairing with entreptrenurship and also with the financing will be able to create that industry kosher was not just a certification or labeling or standards but more substantial than in it we have to able to create products and open up the field work measuring the extent to anyone for children of the nation I believe that tourism halal the numbers are now potential there in 3300 billion and one trillion US dollars .
also for in the year 2030 will be an opportunity that should we take and we are not allowed to be the market we should be able to supply the needs of the economy of sharia world .
in fact we are already a long time to build about economics finance sharia and also products kosher and now already many results were achieved even product parts of our site is now in the world is more substantial than the products of products of other countries because it is we determined that banks we also become the largest in the world and also insurance our capital market we became the largest in the world .
and even also the products halal we also will be products kosher mainstay us to around the world because of it if possible later we will accelerate the process of development to form the body of Agency Development Economics syariah I guess it was .
yes before I want to continue the tour kosher we are already defined become number one in the world is the world of this we will focus and concentration in here with products products halal already earlier I conveyed also laterweeks ahead will we have inaugurated the halal park in Jakarta and will enlarge again to become a district And that's our chance .
introducing products product kosher us .
either one of the potential economies are very large is finance which is a savings of the prospective pilgrims Hajj is during this occurs some doubts about the management of funds are those with the best we want to establish a bank tube Hajj where later , the potential of the managed in modern sharia but efficient , transparent and funds that could be really helpful to people and not be abused for the interests of others so it is one of the efforts of our.
I see management course, the ecosystem that should be able as a country with a population of Muslim World we create institutions for example finance we had time to have a bank of sharia are the largest in asean I touched why central finance sharia was not in Jakarta, but there is good in Kuala Lumpur instead Hongkong and London also develops together with Prabowo Sandi that we believe a strong government is in favor of the creator and the opportunity will be able to make Jakarta the center of Islamic finance .
you wanna test your vice president okay thank you sir president it's for is one of those sectors that is highly developed along with digital economic development and lots of enthusiasts are mobile legend one of them and I feel we have the opportunity to create products that really master the world market for the sector economy creative is the children younger millennial Indonesia is terrific terrific once I was traveling to the entire territory of Indonesia they in still the optimism I sebutnya as a generation of pop them positively upbeat and productive strategy we very clearly back to entrepreneurship and key government is facilitate .
because we are not too could regulate the industry are very fast growing and finally ends for what for the welfare of the people by opening a field of work that measuring the extent not until Indonesia are of course the market is very large it is only focused on overrun by product products imported included in product products Esports and we will facilitate the government to work together with the home ready for work for children younger that we launched yesterday we would make the events of exercise so that we also have to winners of the world but not until Esport it could affect the course generation to the next we do not have akhlakul that karimah by because it was our focus on the development of the ecosystem is based economies digital must lead to the opportunity field work for children .
young people are ready to work home for young people ready to develop and immediately concrete to provide specific strategies for the development of exports .
we as the government does need to quickly respond and respond quickly to changes in the global time of this .
happens goods new entry so fast every day and artificial intelligent internet of .
virtual reality thing of big data when in the field of finance bitcoin cryptocurrency it was also at this there is a profession that now have children young happy into gamers become .
gamers by reason that the government build infrastructure digital good broadband with speeds high palapa ring, 4g, so that children younger we have the infrastructure in the developing profession as gamers who both build the ecosystem were comfortable Bagir they kept trying to make the game and this I think an opportunity that great for the industry in Indonesia will we see also that the value of the economy in the field is growing very rapidly note that I received in 2017 turnover had reached 11 12 billion with growth per year 25 to 30% .
by because it was not until we missed respond to any changes that there is then also we look at the budgets of ad now shifted to there shifted to there in a number of the very large is also to be seen and to watch out so that we respond to the regulations are correct then also be a player Esport the professionals that need a physical that both need exercises that detail so strongly later so professional.
I focus later on the policies of me in the things that is fundamental .
which responds to the food needs of the Indonesian people , Indonesia increases agricultural production , increases income for farmers, protects the livelihoods and income of fishermen, increases the quality of life of honoraryteacher laborers , which I will focus digitally is good , but our people need food self - sufficiency . Food in affordable prices, we have to lower the prices of our people, it is difficult, we have to protect Indonesia's wealth , which I will focus on.
I remembered the story of a brother Rahman is a child younger millennia I met in Sidrap South Sulawesi , he uses technology in industrial agriculture and time served in DKI companies belonging to local enterprises Food Stationto buy rice from the millennial-millennial who now enter into industrial agriculture me .
amazed they have committed a lot of states that millennial is yes definitely going to town to leave the countryside turns a lot once the millennial-millennial like Rahman along Prabowo Sandi we will create Rahman Rahman else Rahman Rahman's new in the entire territory of Indonesia we should be able to children younger this with technology digital technologies are related to agricultural mechanization they could improve the productivity of the sector of agriculture us , do not continue we finally have to month-bulani with the price of materials subject expensive but we are also at one time had to dream that we could be exporting food already time wis wayahe Indonesia should to become a world food economy and energy force , thank you .
please Mr. Jokowi who I respect we appreciate the focus on the digital economy and we agree but the problem- solving approach related to community services for cheap food for pre- work and so on it really does not use the power of digital technology .
we offer a card super magic that exist in the wallet each ie E-ID card that can resolve the three issues mentioned as well and this has been tried yesterday at an event entrepreneur submit by scientist-scientist ITB thank God goes with good but the question is not that pack the question is this in the news that the balance of trade of the Republic of Indonesia still overdrawn father stated stupid really us and certainly this become a thing that makes us so sad that now we are a deficit balance of trade -8 billion dollars with China we -18 billion dollars we are proud of the development of e-commerce with the development of technology digital and unicorn-unicorn whose father call but we are inundated with products from .
outside the country I am also touched that imports of oil and gas which become part of the biggest is actually could be solved with the approach and the other by because it questions my strategy you like anything to restorethe balance of trade us so that we can be victorious like governments before that could be exporting not only the importer and open the door as wide as possible for anything to import thank you .
I guess , the data is the most that should be me to say how much .
the year 2018 is the balance we deficits less over 8 billion US dollars , but in the quarter of the first year is tried in view deficit fell by 0.67 billion dollars means that the business we desperately to suppress the deficit balance of trade is not messing around what that would like us to do to front substituting goods goods imported it must be done in Indonesia. Energy Petrochemical Industry- must exist in Indonesia as the largest import we exist there and then oil and gas we have started to build the refinery and the construction is to front I believe that the deficit is going to be us .
remove indeed the key is to build industry in the country by reason that the future had been me to say that industrialization downstream is becoming a key and it must be our enforced by policy we also already do restrictionsare ready to export the products were associated with the source of the power of nature that must be made L / C to limit that does not happen the transfer pricing between us with the buyers that exist in the outside and we expect the ways of this but it does require time trust is not possible through the hands directly completed .
yes of course we saw that the end was what that felt by the community with the deficit of the trade that should we face now is certainly the February data we have the deficit down because also imports fell and imports downthat what is material that is required for the process of production we have actually even alarming us but we are back to the point main that if we run into a deficit balance of trade and we open the doors of import as much as possible should the price of the price of materials subject we were affordable cost mustinya price .
the energy that is being complained now by mothers in all regions of Indonesia that I always ask the price of electricity to go down or up and up how about the prices of staples down or up and up cheap or expensive expensive shopping well this is not resolved with trade policies and we are with me sir Prabowo has a strategy which we refer to as the big push strategy, strategy of encouragement great we will pour how self-sufficiency in food self-sufficiency in food is we push the process of production of our fertilizer launched by the farmers could obtain seeds can get drugs that cost and stop imports when harvesting for energy we have to build a biofuel we have ten million hectares of land damaged land abandoned us wake up so that anything that happens mother Mia in Tegal complain that the cost of the bills of electricity was 300 400 thousand now already at the top .
1 million is what must we accomplish together Prabowo Sandi we will lower the price of electricity we will make sure that the price of the price of groceries cost without effort issuing cards new .
